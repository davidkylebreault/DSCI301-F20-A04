## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Intial analysis indicated there was no real relationship between sepal length and sepal width. However, when trying to determine if there were underlying causes for this relationship, it appears as though different species have different relationships with sepal length and width. Seperating out the data by species and adding a regression line helps see the relationship.
